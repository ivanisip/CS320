## ðŸ§  Reflection

In this course, I developed unit-tested Java applications focused on contact and task management. To ensure my code was both **functional and secure**, I applied rigorous unit testing using JUnit. These tests validated expected behavior, caught invalid input, and helped me identify edge cases early. I also ensured secure design by limiting the exposure of class fields and validating inputs in constructors and update methods to prevent issues like null values or overly long strings.

When designing software, I begin by identifying **user requirements**, often derived from the project specification. For example, the contact service required storing and updating specific fields like name, phone, and address. I translated these requirements into clearly defined constraints and methods within my code. By doing so, I created a structure that not only met the userâ€™s needs but also made it easy to test and maintain.

My **software design approach** involves starting with simple class structures and building services around them. I separate responsibilities between classes, such as using `Contact` for data and `ContactService` for operations. I use iterative testing and refactoring to improve code quality and ensure each component works well both on its own and as part of the system. This process has helped me gain confidence in writing reliable, well-tested software.# CS320
